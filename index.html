        So does his AL results were average but he somehow managed to pass all the Subjects. 
        Later he realised his passion on Computing and Miraculously he got an opportunity to study at a 
        private institute as a Software Engineering Undergraduate. That's the life changing moment of Gapilesh. 
        After all these years, Gapilesh was tired of being average and started his PRIME TIME. No one would have 
        expected such a change from a naughty boy who was just an average.</p>

        He started thinking in multiple perspectives and in the shoes of people to make effective decisions. 
        He started doing meditation, reading good books and surrounded himself with real friends. He became fit 
        physically, mentally, and spritually.</p>
